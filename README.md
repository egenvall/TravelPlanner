# TravelPlanner - Work in progresss
Improved travel planner for gothenburg [Tram | Bus | Boat | Train]
The project is a work in progress, design etc is unfinished.

The goal of this project is to create a simplified, easier to use Travel Planner for Gothenburg's local traffic.

###The learning purpose is:  
- Material Design Guidelines   
- Working with RxJava2/RxAndroid2 (and interaction with RxJava & RxAndroid).  
- Complex Layouts through ConstraintLayout.
- Working with a "flawed" API in the sense that it does not behave the same depending on what is returned, i.e irregular JSON response.  
- Persisting user information  

##End-game features:
Customizable favourites, Search History, Location based search, Tourist mode, Directions to the relevant stop + feature requests.
